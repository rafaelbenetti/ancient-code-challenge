# Frontend Developer Test Angular/Qwik

## Task:

- Create an Angular or Qwik project
- Show a list of posts from this https://graphqlzero.almansi.me/
- Add search and pagination on the list
- Add functionality to create, view, update and delete posts. It's important that the list and posts update based on the CRUD operations.
- Note that the API CRUD operations wonâ€™t perform any change on the API data, you will need to manually update the local state based
  on the response.

## Looking for usage:

- On Angular we are looking for usage of Apollo GraphQL, RxJS and NgRx
- On Qwik we are looking for usage of Context API
- Effective use of state management for the CRUD operations
- Effective use of routes
- CSS vars and utility classes

## Important:

- Clean/readable code
- Feel free to use a css library like Tailwind or Bootstrap

## Delivery:

- Provide us with the link to a GIT repository that we can access publicly ( Github, Gitlab, etc)
  or a ZIP file with the result of the test
